# bde-search-examples

Simple one page search examples with react and nuxt like on bde. This was done
using react/typescript with vite and nuxt. Both projects are pretty much the same logic wise.

### Why both?

I had fun doing it in react and since it was mentioned that doing it in nuxt would be appreciated, I dipped my feet into nuxt a little and tried to reproduce it.

## How to run

### For the react app

- `cd bde-search-react`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- The app will run on `http://localhost:5173/`

### For the nuxt app

- `cd bde-search-nuxt`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- The app will run on `http://localhost:3000/`
